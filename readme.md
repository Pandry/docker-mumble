Howdy!

This is my SUPER basic mumble docker setup.

Basically, drop a mumble-server.ini and (optionally) a mumble-server.sqlite db into the mumble-volume folder and run docker-compose up -d. You should have a mumble setup wherever you online things.

I'm personally using this for Rackspace's Carina ( http://getcarina.com )
